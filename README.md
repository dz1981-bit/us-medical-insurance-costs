# us-medical-insurance-costs
Portfolio project from Codecademy
This was a portfolio project I completed for Codecademy. It required that I analize the data for medical costs. The data includes age, sex, bmi, smoking status and insurance costs. This project also afforded me an opportunity to practice ploting graphs.
